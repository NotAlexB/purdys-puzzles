# Mr. Purdy's CS Puzzles

This is a collection of the monthly puzzles that I put up on the chalk board outside of my classroom.  The puzzles are sorted by month.  Solutions are provided *after* the month in which the puzzle was posted has ended. 

## Note:
Starting with the March Puzzle, a second prize will be awarded at the end of the month for the shortest run-time solution.  In order to qualify, your submission must include code to measure the runtime and correctly display it in seconds, to 3 decimal places.
