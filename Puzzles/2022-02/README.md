A number's "persistence" is the number of steps required to reduce it to a single digit by multiplying all its digits to obtain a second number, then multiplying all the digits of that number to obtain a third number, and so on until a one digit number is obtained.  For example 77 (base 10) has a persistence of 4 because it requires 4 steps to reduce it to 1 digit: 77 - 49 - 36 - 18 - 8.  The smallest decimal (base 10) number of persistence one is 10.  The smallest decimal number of persistence 5 is 679.  

The smallest hexadecimal (base 16) number of persistence 2 is 28<sub>16</sub> (28<sub>16</sub> - 10<sub>16</sub> - 0<sub>16</sub>).  Find the smallest hexadecimal number of persistence 6.
