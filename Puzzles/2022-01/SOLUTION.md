Solutions:

Carson and Nathaniel solved this one by hand.  Based on their work, it looks like they realized that to be balanced with 2022, the month and day were pretty limited (at most could add up to 6).  This results in a relative small number (17) of dates that are balanced:

112022,
1122022,
1212022,
1302022,
2112022,
2202022,
3102022,
1032022,
10142022,
10232022,
1122022,
11132022,
11222022,
1212022,
12122022,
12212022,
12302022

Adding them up, while tedious, isn't terribly difficult.
