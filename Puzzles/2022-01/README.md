# January 2022 Puzzle

A positive integer is called "balanced" if the first half of its digits *sums* to the same value as the last half of its digits.  For example, 1221, 13722, and 275680 are balanced numbers.

If we write a date, mdy, using the fewest digits necessary (for example, January 1, 2022 would be 112022 and December 30, 2022 would be written 12302022) if the resulting number is balanced, we can call that date a "balanced day".

The two days above are both balanced, and their sum is 12414044.  Find the sum of all of the balanced days in the year 2022.
