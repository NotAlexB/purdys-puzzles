# February 2020 Puzzle

The *aliquot parts* of a number are the proper divisors of a number that are less than the number.  

For example, the aliquot parts of `12` are `1, 2, 3, 4 and 6`.

*Equivalent numbers* are numbers where the sums of their aliquot parts are identical.  

For instance, 159, 559, and 703 are equivalent since their aliquot parts sum to 57.

Find the pair of equivalent numbers, less than 2020, that are farthest apart.
