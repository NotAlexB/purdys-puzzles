Four points are plotted at random on a coordinate plane. 

Consider the following two sets of four points:

A(-679,230), B(672,-254), C(-75,724), D(52,148)

W(-753,457), X(-966,-95), Y(-709,-414), Z(-356,223)

It can be verified that [triangle ABC contains point D](./triangle1.png), whereas [triangle WXY does not contain point Z](./triangle2.png).

Using [triangles.txt](./triangles.txt), a text file containing the coordinates of ten thousand "random" triangles and another point (one triangle+point per line), find the number of triangles that contain their point. 

Note: Triangle ABC and point D, and triangle WXY and point Z are the first two lines of the file.
