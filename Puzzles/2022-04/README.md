## April 2022 Puzzle

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_number): Lucas Numbers are an integer sequence named after the mathematician Francois Lucas (1842-91), who studied both that sequence and the closely related Fibonacci numbers.

Similar to Fibonacci numbers, each Lucas number is defined to be the sum of its two immediate previous terms.  That is, L<sub>n</sub> = L<sub>n-1</sub> + L<sub>n-2</sub>.  

The first few Lucas numbers are L<sub>1</sub> = 2, L<sub>2</sub>= 1, L<sub>3</sub> = 3, L<sub>4</sub> = 4, L<sub>5</sub> = 7, L<sub>6</sub> = 11, L<sub>7</sub> = 18, L<sub>8</sub> = 29, L<sub>9</sub> = 47, L<sub>10</sub> = 76, L<sub>11</sub> = 123.  

Notice that index 6 is the first Lucas number with 2 digits and index 11 is the first term with 3 digits.

What is the *index* of the first term with 2022 digits?
