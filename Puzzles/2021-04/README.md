## April Showers Bring May Flowers

You may have heard this saying before.  What does it mean?  Well, let's break it down [*Wikipedia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_shower) style:

```
In parts of the Northern Hemisphere, an April shower is rain during the month of April. One of the major causes of the often heavy downpours is the position of the jet stream.  In early spring, the jet stream starts to move northwards, allowing large depressions to bring strong winds and rain in from the Atlantic. In one day the weather can change from springtime sunshine to winter sleet and snow. The track of these depressions can often be across Ireland and Scotland bringing bands of rain followed by heavy showers (often of hail or snow) and strong blustery winds.
```

I bet you didn't know the age-old saying was talking about the United Kingdom!  In fact, many parts of the United States don’t receive that much rain in April. Furthermore, in some of the country’s southernmost regions, the weather is regularly warm enough for flowers to bloom far sooner than May.

Still though, doesn't it kind of make you wonder: *How much rain **do** we get in April?*  If the amount of precipitation in April is more than 1/12 of the annual precipitation for that year, we will say that there were "April showers" that year.

[This data file](./precipitation_data.csv) has precipitation totals for Flour Bluff/Corpus Christi for days from September 1, 1988 until February 28, 2021 (with some gaps where data is not available).  Of the years with data for every month (though not necessarily every day), what is the product of the four digit years in which there were "April showers"?
