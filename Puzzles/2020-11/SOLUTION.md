Here is an explanation provided by Xander Nguyen:

> I noticed that all of the letters were in alphabetical order so I assumed that the actual letter had nothing to do with it. I separated each group of letters and counted it out.(...) I then (listed) all of the numbers and noticed that none of them were over 26. I assumed that they were letters and mapped out each number to the letter and came up with:
 > "T H I S I S A S E C R E T M E S S A G E N O W Y O U K N O W W H A T W A S D O N E T O C R E A T E I T E N C O D E Y O U R N A M E F I R S T A N D L A S T U S I N G T H E S A M E M E T H O D A N D S U B M I T I T A S Y O U R R E S P O N S E"
> if you separate it you get:
