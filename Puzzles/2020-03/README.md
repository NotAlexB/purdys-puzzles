# March 2020 Puzzle

Given a number, working from left-to-right, if no digit is less than the digit to its left, it is called an "increasing" number; for example, 144589.

Similarly if no digit is greater than the digit to its right it is called a "decreasing" number; for example, 55310.

In honor of Spring Break, let's call a positive integer that is neither "increasing" nor "decreasing" a "beach ball" number; for example, 3072020.

There cannot be any beach ball numbers below one hundred, but just over half of the numbers below 1,000 (525) are beach ball numbers.  The least number for which the proportion of beach ball numbers first reaches 50% is 538, ie. from 1-538, there are 269 beach ball numbers.

The least number for which the proportion of beach ball numbers first reaches 75% is 3,088 and the least with a proportion of 90% is 21,780.

Find the least number for which the proportion of beach ball numbers is exactly 99%.
