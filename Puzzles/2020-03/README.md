Working from left-to-right, if no digit is less than the digit to its left, it is called an increasing number; for example, 144589.

In honor of Spring Break, let's call a positive integer that is neither increasing nor decreasing a "beach ball" number; for example, 3072020.

There cannot be any beach ball numbers below one hundred.  The least number for which the percentage of beach ball numbers first reaches 50% is 538.

The least number for which the percentage of beach ball numbers first reaches 75% is 3088.  In fact, Beach ball numbers become more and more common and by the time we reach 21780 the proportion of beach ball numbers is equal to 90%.

Find the least number for which the proportion of beach ball numbers is exactly 99%.
